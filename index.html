            The economy is a complex system that is affected by a variety of factors. When economy has hard time, businesses may struggle to stay afloat, leading to layoffs and a rise in the unemployment rate. This can result in reduced consumer spending, as those who are out of work have less money to spend, further exacerbating the economic downturn.

            <p>
            <b>GDP </b>stands for gross domestic product, which is meant to represent the total dollar value of all goods and services produced over a specific period of time.
            </p>
            <p><b>Debt-to-GDP ratio</b> is the metric comparing a country's public debt to its gross domestic product The higher the debt-to-GDP ratio, the less likely the country will pay back its debt and the higher its risk of default, which could cause a financial panic in the domestic and international markets.
            </p>
            <p><b>Unemployment rates</b> are often used as a key indicator of the health of the economy.</p>
            With our visualizations, I want to <b>show the relationship between two economy factors(GDP, Debt) and unemployment rate in different countries, how they indicate a coming massive layoff and also explore how unemployment rate affected other aspect of life.</b>

        <h2>Unemployment rates of Japan, Canada and United States</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>The big picture: </h3>
          <p>
            Let's start off by taking a look at the big picture. Unemployment rates have fluctuated significantly over time in various countries 
            due to a variety of factors such as economic policies, technological advancements, and global events. 
            For instance, countries like the United States and Canada have experienced periods of low unemployment in the past, 
            but have also seen an increase in recent years. On the other hand, some countriy like japan have a stable unemployment rates. Overall, understanding the trends of unemployment changes is crucial for policymakers 
            to implement effective strategies to reduce joblessness and promote economic growth.

            Next, we can take a look at the global debt to GDP ratio and its correlation with unemployment rate.

            The relationship between the debt to GDP ratio and the unemployment rate is complex and multifaceted. On one hand, high levels of debt can lead to higher interest payments and reduced government spending, which can ultimately lead to lower economic growth and higher unemployment rates. On the other hand, a high debt to GDP ratio can also indicate that a government is investing in infrastructure and other measures that can ultimately lead to job creation and economic growth. Additionally, a high unemployment rate can also lead to higher levels of government debt as the government spends more on social safety net programs. Ultimately, the relationship between these two economic indicators depends on a variety of factors and is influenced by both domestic and international economic conditions.

        <p>Clearly, we can see that the debt to GDP ratio of Japan, US and Canada are very similar since 2000, and Debt to GDP ratio all went up when unemployment rate increased (from 2009 to 2010 and from 2019 to 2020).</p>

            Let's move on and explore the relationship between GDP and unemployment rate. The relationship between GDP and the unemployment rate is crucial in understanding the overall health of an economy. When the GDP is growing, it typically leads to increased job opportunities, which in turn can lower the unemployment rate. Conversely, when the GDP is shrinking or stagnant, it can lead to job losses and a rise in the unemployment rate. However, it's important to note that the relationship is not always linear, and there can be lag effects between changes in GDP and changes in unemployment rate. Additionally, other factors, such as demographic changes and government policies, can also impact the unemployment rate independent of GDP.

          <h2>How unemployment rate affected Entertainment Mark?</h2>
          <p>The relationship between video sales and unemployment rate is not straightforward. In times of economic hardship, consumers may be more likely to stay at home and watch movies, leading to an increase in video sales. However, high levels of unemployment can also mean reduced disposable income and less spending on non-essential goods like entertainment, which can ultimately lead to lower video sales. Ultimately, the impact of unemployment on video sales depends on a variety of factors, including consumer behavior and market conditions.</p>

            It is interesting to see that Japan and North America area video sales dropped when unemployment rate peaked in 2019, which suggests that video games are a discretionary spending item for many households, and during times of economic uncertainty, entertainment is not the top priority.<br>

        <div class="section-column">
          <div class="left">
            <p>
                H1B visas are non-immigrant visas that allow US employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. The relationship between H1B visas and the unemployment rate is complex. Some argue that H1B workers may displace US workers, particularly in fields like IT. However, others contend that H1B workers help fill gaps in the labor market and stimulate economic growth, ultimately leading to job creation and lower unemployment rates. The impact of H1B visas on the US labor market remains a topic of debate among policymakers and economists.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Since 2000, Japan, Canada, and the US have experienced similar trends in their unemployment rates, with increases in 2009 and 2020. Canada and the US had the highest unemployment rates in 2020, while Japan experienced its highest unemployment rate in 2009. Debt to GDP ratios for these countries also followed similar trends, with increases occurring when unemployment rates rose from 2009 to 2010 and from 2019 to 2020. When GDP dropped in 2009 and 2020, the unemployment rate increased rapidly. Video sales in Japan and North America decreased during the 2019 unemployment rate peak, suggesting that entertainment is a discretionary spending item for many households during times of economic uncertainty. Interestingly, the H1B denials number is negatively correlated with the unemployment rate, while the H1B approvals number has no significant correlation with the unemployment rate.
