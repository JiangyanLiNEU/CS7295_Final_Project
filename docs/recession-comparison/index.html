        <p>
          Not too long ago, there were a lot of mass layoffs from tech companies accompanied by the continuing increase
          of interest rate. Therefore, a lot of people are worried about a pending recession. In order to know if we
          have are heading into a recession, we need to first know more about what a recession is and how they manifest
          in the economy.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Data Source</h2>
        <p>
          The main data source is the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org">Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)</a>.
          The datasets include interest rate, general unemployment rate, unemployment rate by ethnicities, and
          unemployment rate by US counties.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also used an
          <a
            href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/past-recessions.asp#toc-the-rolling-adjustment-recession-april-1960february-1961"
            >Investopedia article</a
          >
          to identify recession periods and respetive name of the recessions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">What is a recession?</h2>
        <p>
          The formal definition of recession is: a period of temporary economic decline during which trade and
          industrial activity are reduced, generally identified by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters.
        </p>
        <p>Now that we know how a recession is defined, let's see what they look like.</p>

            <p>This chart shows the <em>overall unemployment rate in the US since 1965</em>.</p>
            <p>Can you guess when there were recessions happening in the US?</p>
          </div>

          <div class="step" data-step="2">
            <p>Let's highlight the recession periods. How close were your guesses?</p>
            <p>We can see some interesting patterns here:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>The unemployment rate seems to always increase during a recession.</strong></li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  The unemployment rate tend to start increasing at the start of a recession, and tend to peak at the
                  end.
                </strong>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              From this pattern we just found, we should be able to say that we are not yet in a recession (as of March
              2023).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="step" data-step="3">
            <p>How about the interest rate? Another common economic indicator to look for is the interest rate.</p>
            <p>This chart shows the <em>interest rate in the US since 1965</em>.</p>
            <p>Can you spot when there were recessions happening from the interest rate?</p>
          </div>

          <div class="step" data-step="4">
            <p>That was likely harder to do. How did you do?</p>
            <p>We can also see some patterns here:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>The interest rate tend to decrease during a recession.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>The interest rate tend to increase before a recession starts.</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>From this pattern, we might say that we are indeed heading towards a recession (as of March 2023).</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">What if we put recessions side by side?</h2>
        <div>Now that we have seen the big picture, let's dive a bit deeper into the recessions.</div>
      </div>

      <section id="section2" class="scroll">

          <div class="step" data-step="5">
            <p>This chart shows the unemployment rate after each <em>"pre-Covid"</em> recession.</p>
            <p>
              Here the Covid Recession is excluded because it is a unique recession (the narrow spike at the tail of the
              Great Recession), because its cause is a health crisis instead of a financial one.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this chart, we can see that
              <strong>
                the <em>Double-Dip Recession</em> is the only recession that peaked at the end of the recession
              </strong>

          <div class="step" data-step="6">
            <p>
              If we align the recession by the start instead, we can better see that
              <strong>
                the unemployment peak occurs at a similar time, around 2 years after the recessions started.
              </strong>

              recessions?
            </p>
            <p>
              We can see that of the 4 recessions,
              <strong>
                the <em>Great Recession</em> has the biggest increase in unemployment rate and took the longest to
                recover.

              <strong>
                <em>African-Americans</em> have the highest unemployment rate at all times since 2000 except during the
                <em>Covid recession</em>.

            <p>What about an indexed version of the unemployment rates?</p>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-hand-pointer"></i>
              </button>
              , we can see that the unemployment rates of each ethnicities behave similarly except for the peak of Covid
              Recession, where African-Americans has the smallest spike.
            </p>
            <p>
              It more obvious if we index the rates at <em>the end of the Covid Recession</em>
              <button class="interactor primary" id="endOfCR">
                <i class="fa-regular fa-hand-pointer"></i>

            <p>
              This means
              <strong>
                all ethnicities except African-Americans were affected more by the <em>Covid Recession</em> than the
                <em>Great Recession</em>.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We can also see that
              <strong>
                the unemployment rate for African-Americans decreased the slowest after the
                <em>Covid Recession</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
              We can see that the
              <strong><em>COVID Recession</em> had a larger overall unemployment rate increase</strong> than the Great
              Recession.

                At the end of the Dot-Bomb Recession, most of the US counties had a decrease in unemployment rate.

            <p>
              If you still remember, <em>the Dot-Bomb Recession</em> is one of the recessions that have an unemployment
              rate peak after the end.
